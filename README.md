# 🤖 Purchasing Automation Suite (FastAPI + LLM + Framer)

This project is an **enterprise-grade AI solution** designed to automate the end-to-end purchasing workflow. By combining a high-performance **FastAPI** backend with a **LangChain Multi-agent** architecture, it transforms raw inventory data into deep analytical reports and ready-to-use procurement documents.

## 🛠️ Actual Tech Stack

This project implements a production-ready architecture using the following technologies:

* **Backend**: Python, FastAPI (Asynchronous API, SSE Streaming)
* **AI Framework**: LangChain (Multi-agent Orchestration, Tool Binding)
* **LLM**: OpenAI GPT-4o / GPT-4o-mini
* **Vector Database**: ChromaDB (RAG - Retrieval Augmented Generation)
* **Frontend Interface**: React, Framer (Custom Code Components), TypeScript
* **Data Processing**: Pandas (CSV), PyPDF (Extraction), Python-docx (Word Generation)
* **Infrastructure**: Docker (Containerization for Hugging Face Spaces)

## 🚀 Key Technical Competencies



### 1️⃣ Real-time Event Streaming (SSE)
Beyond a simple request-response model, this system utilizes **Server-Sent Events (SSE)** to provide real-time feedback to the user at every stage of the pipeline: CSV parsing → Item Grouping → AI Analysis → Document Generation.

### 2️⃣ Scalable RAG-based Data Ingestion
* **Bulk Processing**: Developed a scalable API capable of ingesting multiple PDFs or **ZIP archives** for high-volume data training.
* **Automated Metadata Extraction**: Utilizes Regex to automatically identify Supplier names and ItemCodes within documents, mapping them to Vector DB metadata for high-precision retrieval.

### 3️⃣ Multi-Agent Orchestration
Instead of relying on a single prompt, the system orchestrates **five specialized agents**. The Analysis Agent uses Tools to search the knowledge base, while specialized Documentation Agents transform those findings into various professional formats.

### 4️⃣ Ephemeral Environment Optimization (Memory-first)
Designed specifically for serverless/ephemeral environments like Hugging Face Spaces, the system supports a **memory-first approach** where documents are generated as bytes and encoded to **Base64** for instant client-side download, bypassing persistent disk requirements.
